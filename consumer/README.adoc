== Standalone Java Consumers

These are self contained Java functions, each implements `java.util.function.Consumer` and can be used as a component that consumes a value in a variety of streaming application platforms such as Spring Cloud Data Flow, Project RIFF etc.
The functions can be run as part of standalone Spring Boot applications.

=== Available Consumers

`cassandra-consumer`

A `Function<Object, Mono<? extends WriteResult>>` consumer to perform an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation in the Cassandra according provided `cassandra`, `cassandra.cluster` and `spring.data.cassandra` configuration properties.
An operation is performed in a reactive manner, so the returned `Mono` can be combined with some other post-function or subscribed directly in the target application.

`log-consumer`

A `Consumer` which accepts incoming messages and logs them using Spring Integration `LoggingHandler` and `LogConsumerProperties` configuration properties.
If incoming payload is a `byte[]` and `contentType` header is text-compatible, it is converted into a `String`.
Otherwise the payload is passing to logging as is.
The Apache `commons-logging` is used as a framework for logging.
Any logging library which is able to bridge from `commons-logging` can be used as a target logging system.

`rabbit-consumer`

TODO: provide a description

`mongo-consumer`

A `Function<Message<?>,Mono<Void>>` which accepts a message and stores the payload to a Mongo DB collection using the `ReactiveMongoDbStoringMessageHandler`.
The message handler uses the reactive Mongo DB drivers so is completely non-blocking.

`jdbc-consumer`

A `Consumer` which accepts incoming messages and inserts them into a target relational database.
See `JdbcConsumerProperties` JavaDocs for more information what and how to configure for this consumer.

NOTE: A respective JDBC driver has to be added into classpath to make this consumer working properly against the target data base.

`file-consumer`

A `Consumer` that accepts incoming messages and write them into a target file in a directory.

`redis-consumer`

A `Consumer` that sends incoming messages to Redis.
